BUS_UC: Benign and Malignant Breast Ultrasound Images with Annotations
Overview 🔬
The BUS_UC dataset is a collection of ultrasound images of breast tumors, categorized as either benign or malignant. This dataset is intended for research and development in the areas of breast tumor segmentation and classification. All images have a resolution of 256 × 256 pixels.

Dataset Contents 📁
The dataset includes:

Benign Tumor Images: 358 ultrasound images of benign breast tumors.
Malignant Tumor Images: 453 ultrasound images of malignant breast tumors.
Note: This dataset does not include ground truth images from the original source. Annotations for segmentation and classification were created with the help of an experienced radiologist.

Data Acquisition and Annotation 🧑‍⚕️
The ultrasound images were obtained from the website Ultrasound Cases (ultrasoundcases.info). As this source did not provide ground truth images, an experienced radiologist was involved in annotating the benign and malignant tumor images specifically for segmentation and classification tasks.

Potential Uses 💡
This dataset can be utilized for various research activities, including but not limited to:

Breast Tumor Segmentation: Developing and evaluating algorithms to accurately segment tumor regions in ultrasound images. ✂️
Breast Tumor Classification: Training and testing machine learning and deep learning models to classify tumors as benign or malignant based on ultrasound images. 🧠
Comparative Studies: Comparing the performance of different segmentation and classification techniques on breast ultrasound images. 📊
Educational Purposes: Providing students and researchers with a labeled dataset for learning and experimentation in medical image analysis. 📚
